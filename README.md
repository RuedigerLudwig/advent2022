# Advent of Code 2022

Here are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Thanks to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl) for the great puzzles and the great time I have solving them.

My goal is to solve each puzzle on the day it was posted. Also I want to create code that is correct (of course), but some I would also understand in about a year. So a readable solution is preferable to one that is only correct. This is why I use TDD, classes and comments where they technically might not be necessary.

I use python 3.11 without any libraries beyond the standard.
